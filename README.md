All files and documents of building my personal website that is hosted on GitHub Pages

I think I've got things running smoothly and fixed some major bugs, but feel free to file issues or make pull requests if you want to improve the generic template / theme. Note: many files and functionalities in the original template have been removed to facilitate my needs.

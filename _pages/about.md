I am a postdoctoral scholar at the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute of the Pennsylvania State University. My research interests span a broad range of topics focusing mainly on hydrogeology, water geochemistry, environmental sciences, and data mining. In my current research, I have combined field geology, state-of-the-art geochemcal analyses, as well as emerging data mining (big data) tools to study energy resources (e.g., shale gas and geothermal) across the North America.

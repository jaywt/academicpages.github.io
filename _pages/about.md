I am a postdoctoral scholar at the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute of the Pennsylvania State University. My research interests span a broad range of topics focusing mainly on hydrogeology, water geochemistry, environmental sciences, and data mining. In my current research, I have combined field geology, state-of-the-art geochemcal analyses, as well as emerging data mining (big data) tools to study energy resources (e.g., shale gas and geothermal) across the North America.

## Research Questions

* What are the sources of hydrocarbon in conventional and unconventional reservoirs?
* How does the subsurface fluids (e.g., natural gas, oil, and groundwater) migrate acorss formations?
* What are the impact of energy recovery activities on surrounding environments (both above ground and subsurface)?
* What is the best practice in managing and utilizing big geoscience datasets?

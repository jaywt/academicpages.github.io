I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute of the Pennsylvania State University. My research interests span a broad range of topics focusing mainly on hydrogeology, geochemistry, environmental sciences, and data mining. In my research, I have blended field geology, state-of-the-art geochemical analyses, as well as emerging data mining (big data) tools in my research.

## Research Interest

* Water cycle within coupled human (e.g., energy extraction and urbanization) and natural systems at varying temporal and spatial scales using both data mining (big data) and case study (small data) approaches
* Co-evolution of geosphere and biosphere
* Best practice in managing and utilizing big geoscience datasets
* Open science and open/FAIR data

## Research Keywords

Water sustainability  
Data mining  
Urbanization
Oil and gas  
Geothermal energy  
Noble gas geochemistry

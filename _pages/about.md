## Joining Syracuse University in August 2020

In August 2020, I will be starting as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in [the Department of Earth Sciences](http://earthsciences.syr.edu){:target="_blank"} at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu){:target="_blank"}. My research interests span a broad range of topics focusing mainly on hydrogeology, geochemistry, environmental sciences, and data mining.

I am currently recruiting MS and PhD students to join my research group at Syracuse University, located in Syracuse, New York. Please check the [**Opportunities**](/opportunities){:target="_blank"} page.

## Research Interest

* Water cycle within the coupled human (e.g., energy extraction and urbanization) and natural systems at varying temporal and spatial scales using both data mining (big data) and case study (small data) approaches
* Co-evolution of geosphere and biosphere
* Best practice in managing and utilizing big geoscience datasets
* Open science and open/FAIR data

## Research Keywords

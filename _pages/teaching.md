### EAR 401/601 – Hydrogeology: Fall 2020
* Elements of the hydrologic cycle, properties of aquifers, principles of groundwater flow, groundwater flow to wells, regional groundwater flow, basic water chemistry and groundwater contamination, and field methods and groundwater modeling


## Pennsylvania State University
### GEOSC/GEOG 497 – Data Mining in Environmental Sciences: Fall 2019
*	Applied both conventional and emerging data analytics tools to address real-world environmental science problems through mini-lectures and hands-on projects

### GEOSC 560 – Kinetics of Geological Processes (Interim Instructor): Spring 2017 and Spring 2019
* Basics of isotope geochemistry
* Applied Data-driven models to assess the impact of natural and anthropogenic features on weathering rate on a watershed scale

## University of Michigan (2013 – 2016)
### EARTH 477 – Hydrogeology: 2013 – 2016
* Guided 50+ students to understand the fate and transport of contaminants from Underground Storage Tanks via hands-on hydrogeological lab work and the interpretation of stratigraphic information
### EARTH 408 – Introduction to GIS in the Earth Sciences: Fall 2016
* Implemented 2D & 3D spatial analysis in ArcGIS; received positive teaching evaluation (rated at 4.5-5.0 out of 5.0) from students.

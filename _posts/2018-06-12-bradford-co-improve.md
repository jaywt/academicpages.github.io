Excerpt: Unlike previous studies, our findings show that groundwater quality might even be improving in an area heavily exploited for shale gas â€” northeastern Bradford in PA. In addition, data-mining highlighted a few, rare sites of possible methane contamination close to seven shale gas wells and a few conventional wells. Such sites should be sampled and studied in the field. Rare methane contamination cases are consistent with the overall observation that shale gas production has not downgraded the average groundwater quality overall over time. The team recently reported their findings in the journal [Environmental Science & Technology](/files/Wen_2018_EST.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

Excerpt: Tao Wen, a post-doctoral scholar at Penn State and lead author on the paper, said their methods and findings differed from  previous studies. “Rare methane contamination cases are consistent with the overall observation that shale gas production has not downgraded the average groundwater quality overall over time,” Wen said. The team recently reported their findings in the journal [Environmental Science & Technology](/files/Wen_2018_EST.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
